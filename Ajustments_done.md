### POI structure and data
Change the current POI category structure to a tree where some categories have sub-categories. I have changed the names of some of the existing categories and  added a few more categories/sub-categories.There shall be checkboxes for all of them and ,they shall be unchecked by default and categories with sub-categories shall be collapsed.Use the norwegian terms listed below.The english terms are also listed below in parentheses,but these are just for your reference so you know which icon to use.
